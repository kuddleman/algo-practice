// Loop through String and Make a hash table with the number of occurences of each letter.  

// Only one character may occur an odd number of times. 
 

// Loop through new hash table and counter how many values are odd and how many are even. 
// If count of odds values is greater than 1, return false.  Otherwise, return true
