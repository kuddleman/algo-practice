Write a function to check whether two given strings 
are Permutation of each other or not. A Permutation 
of a string is another string that contains same characters, 
only the order of characters can be different. 

For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are Permutation of each other.

const isPermutation = ( str1, str2 ) => {

  //first check lengths of each string. If 
  // lengths are NOT equal, then they cannot be permutations
  // return FALSE



  // convert each string to an array


  //sort each array alphabetically


  //loop through one array and compare each letter to
  // the corresponding letter in the 2nd array. If the
  // elements being compared are not strictly equal, then
  // return FALSE


  // After the loop is completed, return TRUE
